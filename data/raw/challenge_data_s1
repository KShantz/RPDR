Winner of RuPaul's Drag Race Season One: BeBe Zahara Benet"	"Merle and Santino came in to inform the final three that their last challenge would be to appear in RuPaul's latest video for her song, ""Cover Girl (Put The Bass In Your Walk)."" They would do a group dance, record a verse with rapper Cazwell, and film a solo for Ru's video. To get them prepared, choreographer Ryan Heffington took the final three through the planned dance routine. None of them adapted easily, but Rebecca in particular, struggled with the dancing required. Afterward, each queen got an impromptu sit-down with Ru.
